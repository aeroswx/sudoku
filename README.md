# sudoku
Fortran sudoku program that generates and solves random puzzles.
It can only generate 9! combinations of different sudokus due to some limitations.

The solver also has limitations that depend mainly in the number of clues.
20 to 24 clues are needed for high speed solving (<1 sec up to 5 sec).
Further improvements will be made.
